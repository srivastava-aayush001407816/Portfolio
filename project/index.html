                <h1>Swarm Computing</h1>
                <p>
                    The particle swarm optimization was originally presented by Kennedy and Eberhart, 
                    it has been compared with Genetic Algorithm, it is inspired by social behavior among 
                    individuals, these individuals are moving through an n-dimensional search space, each
                    particle represents a potential solution of the problem, and can remember the best 
                    position it has reached. All the particles can share their information about the search
                    space, so there is a global best solution. In each of iteration, every particle calculates
                    its velocity according to the formula.
                    The basic PSO model consists of a swarm of particles, which are initialized with a population 
                    of random candidate solutions. They move iteratively through the d-dimension problem space to
                    search for the new solutions, where the fitness, f, can be calculated as the certain qualities 
                    measure. Each particle has a position represented by a position-vector xi (i is the index of the particle),
                    and a velocity represented by a velocity-vector vi. Each particle remembers its own best position so far in
                     a vector i-th, and its d- dimensional value is pbest(pid). The best position-vector among the swarm so far 
                     is then stored in the vector i-th, and its d-th dimensional value is gbest(pgd).

                <h1>Day Care</h1>
                <p>
                    The application was intended to help preschool children, the elderly, or those with chronic disabilities with their
                    daily needs. It had 3 active users namely Parents/Guardians, Teachers/Helpers and Admin. The application had various features
                    like Alerts for upcoming annual employee review, Tracking immunization records, Annual registration from original walking date, 
                    secured login for all the participants, dynamic notifications/reminders and a single client single server chat system and  
                    was developed solely in JAVA along with Swing framework for the UI design and was designed for data persistence using files
                    generated on the user's system. The application was designed using SOLID design principles and used concepts like stream API,
                    Lambdas and multi-threading. It also included a progress module for both teachers and guardians for tracking the patient's progress.

                <h1>Financial Aid</h1>
                <p>The application was developed to aid underprivileged students with their financial needs to continue their education by
                    allowing them to connect with available sponsors who wish to provide open or closed sponsorship to the students
                    as per the availability. It has 5 major players Student, Sponsor, Manager, Bank and University and each player has defined 
                    set of roles. Students looking for sponsorships should create a profile, providing their information
                    including proof of financial need, proof of acceptance from University, which will be
                    created upon approval from the Admin once the documents have been verified. There are two types of scholarships, open and closed. The open scholarships would
                    allow the student to make a fund-raising request, and the closed scholarship would allow
                    the student to apply for specific available/multiple sponsorships from the University.
                    The students is allowed to select either of these while creating their profiles. The student can also apply for a loan from the bank if his financial needs are not
                    covered with the sponsorships. Sponsors who wish to help these students can create a profile and help the students accordingly. The Admin
                    controls everything and approves the documents as well as profiles of bank, student and universities. He also has access to a dashboard which 
                    provides details about students and sponsors.

                <h1>Yellow Pages</h1>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this application is to create a website using MVC architecture and hibernate database
                     to facilitate trading of second hand books between peers. The website will allow users to sign-in and 
                     create an account. Once the account is created the user can browse through all the books available and either 
                     choose to trade for another book or buy the book from the owner. A single book could be traded multiple times 
                     and there are no limitations for the category of books. User will be able to select from multiple category and 
                     trade books within a category.The books are added by admin and are modifiable by admin themselves. 
                     The admin portal can only be accessed by authorized users which adds a layer of security to the application.
                      All thebooks are stored in mySQL database using hibernate and are persisted using hibernate annotations. Some of the
                      technologies used include Spring Security to authorize admin login, Angular js to add data to cart and view cartdata,
                      Hibernate Annotations to persist book objects to table and retrieve them, CRUD operations performed by the admin to modify or
                       delete the persisted data, Use of JSTL tags to include code logic into jsp pages and Use of annotation mapping to redirect users to appropriate page
                       to name a few.

                <h1>Gettit.com</h1>
                <p>The application is currently in the works and was started to gain experience in building applications with Spring MVC and 
                    Angular 8. It will be using Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL on the back-end side and on the 
                    front end we will be using Angular 9 and Bootstrap 4. we will also be using Token Based Authentication in the form of JSON 
                    Web Tokens (JWT). The application has features like secured login, ability to store messages as well as users on database, ability
                    to like a message, comment on it, delete it if you're the author and edit it. This application is a miniature version of a popular
                    website known as reddit.com which is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.
