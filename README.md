So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all the other interesting projects I've been working on it took mea little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased upenough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce my portfolio: a fun, blocky,multi-page design with a lot of color,a bit of animation with css on svg, parallax etc. Hope you dig it :)
